# processing-sketches
"Processing Sketches" is a repository of creative coding sketches made with the Processing programming language, showcasing generative art, interactive visualizations, and other experiments with code.

## Running the sketches
To run the sketch, you will need to have Processing installed on your computer.
You can download Processing from the official website at https://processing.org/download/. Once you have installed Processing, simply open the sketch file and click the "Run" button to view the animation.

## Animation samples
"The 'animations' folder contain a collection of animations created using the sketches from the 'sketches' folder of this repository. Each animation is saved as a GIF file and showcases the visual effects and interactions made possible with the Processing programming language.

## Samples
- **Waves Sketch**
  
  This sketch creates a background of circles and waves of color-shifting shapes. The size, spacing, and speed of the shapes are modulated over time, creating a dynamic   and visually interesting effect.
  Here's a preview of the animation:
