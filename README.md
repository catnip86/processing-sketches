# processing-sketches
"Processing Sketches" is a repository of creative coding sketches made with the Processing programming language, showcasing generative art, interactive visualizations, and other experiments with code.

## Running the sketches
To run the sketch, you will need to have Processing installed on your computer.
You can download Processing from the official website at https://processing.org/download/. Once you have installed Processing, simply open the sketch file and click the "Run" button to view the animation.

## Animation samples
"The 'animations' folder contain a collection of animations created using the sketches from the 'sketches' folder of this repository. Each animation is saved as a GIF file and showcases the visual effects and interactions made possible with the Processing programming language.

## Samples
- **Waves Sketch**
  
  This sketch creates a background of circles and waves of color-shifting shapes. The size, spacing, and speed of the shapes are modulated over time, creating a dynamic   and visually interesting effect.
  Here's a preview of the animation:

 - **Gravitational Well Sketch**
  
    The "Gravitational Well" sketch is a 3D particle simulation where particles emerge from random points on the edges of the canvas and move towards the center of the       screen in a gravitational-like movement. As they reach the center of the screen, they disappear and reappear on the edges, creating an endless loop of particle   movement. The particles are displayed as spheres with a randomized color. The sketch is designed to be hypnotic and mesmerizing, with the endless loop of movement drawing the viewer into the center of the well.

  - **Neon Cubes**
  
    The neon cubes sketch is an animation that features cubes moving around in a 3D space. The cubes rotate and   change direction when they collide with each other or the edges of the canvas. The color palette is inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics, featuring bright neon colors that pop against a dark background.

  - **Dancing Boxes**
  
    Dancing Boxes is a creative audio-visual project that generates a mesmerizing animation of colorful, pulsating 3D boxes. The boxes are arranged in a 3x3 grid and react to the rhythm of a provided audio track. They change position and size based on the audio amplitude, creating a dynamic and engaging experience for the viewer.
	To create the animation, the project uses a combination of audio analysis, perlin noise, and 3D rendering techniques. The colors of the boxes are carefully chosen and adjusted based on the audio amplitude and their position in the grid.
